### [FindMyNewHome]

If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here

### Pitch
Find the best value neighborhood for your ideals when house hunting.

### Description
Creating a search tool where you can enter in filters for what you're looking for, house price, parks, proximity of restaurants, school levels, proximity to public transportation and ideal zip codes. This will then show you the different places that match up with your search, allowing you to find the most ideal home. Once the filter is complete, sending them to a realtor.

### Target Audience
Young families looking to invest in a home and finding the perfect match without the influence of a realtor.
