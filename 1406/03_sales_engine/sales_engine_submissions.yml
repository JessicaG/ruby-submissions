    peer_evaluation:
      notes: "Repository was not required in MerchantRepository. In your SE, why have accessor rather than reader? 14 errors in spec harness"
      notes(2): "Overall, clean looking code, good use of the kernel and master find by methods."
      rubric:
        Functional Expectations: 2 "Didn't run off the bat. Needed to require repository in Merchant before we could run the spec harness. Also, BI needs to be done."
        Test-Driven Development: 3 "No real integration tests, lots of unit testing, but would've like to see more testing on edge cases and on BI"
        Encapsulation / Components: 4 "nuff said."
        Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3.5 "Existing code looks good, unsure about sustainability moving forward. Too much in SE, should move out into module."
        Enumerable & Collections: 2.5 "Didn't get a chance to see enumerables because BI was not done."
        Code Sanitation: 1 "By rubric, lines are too long. But it's readable and makes sense."
